# MattTitmuss-UserCentricFrontendMilestoneProject

This will be a Band page for "The Monkees" with the aims of creating 4-5 pages for a target audience made up mainly by fans of the band. The main goals are to provide a platform to the user to see and hear content from the band as well as any new material, as it becomes available. As well as publicise their availibilty to perform at functions such as weddings and parties. Whilst also showcasing any images and creating a social media precense.

I aim to start with a landing page directing users to either information about the band or immediately to the musical content. From here there will be several other pages including images,video or contact. Hopefully designed to appeal its target audience of 60's rock fans.

## UX
 
#### strategy
- 4-5 pages for a 60's rock band.
- target audience = Fans and potential fans.
- goals: 
..* Provide a platform for fans to see and hear content from the band.
..* Publiscise their availibilty to perform at events.
..* show a social media presense

focus = create a platform for band content and publicity.
definition = A home site for a rock band.
value = music to the user and publicity to the band.

#### User stories
As a fan, I want to listen to music, to enjoy a band I like.
As a fan, I want to follow my band, so I can keep up to date on what they're doing.
As a fan, I want to be notified on updates, so that I can keep up on any news.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
- navbar:
..* This navbar is similar to the one bootstrap demo's but with some diferences in breakpoints for burger button. 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

1. Navbar:
    1. Open index page
    2. hover over links to see hover classes
    3. collapse browser to see breakpoint for burger-button, test browser button
    4. 

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
