                                <p>The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1966 and
                                    1971, with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed.
                                    They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider
                                    specifically for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966
                                    to 1968.
                                    The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith,
                                    and Peter Tork; and the English actor and singer Davy Jones.
                                    The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the
                                    songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.</p>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="row bg-soft-brown">
                        <div class="col-sm">
                            <div class="position-two">
                                <p>The four actor-musicians were initially allowed only limited roles in the recording
                                    studio for the first few months of their five-year career as "the Monkees".
                                    This was due in part to the amount of time required to film the television series.
                                    Nonetheless, Nesmith did compose and produce some songs from the beginning,
                                    and Peter Tork contributed limited guitar work on the sessions produced by Nesmith.
                                    All four contributed lead vocals to various tracks.
                                    They eventually fought for the right to collectively supervise all musical output
                                    under the band's name, acting as musicians, singers, songwriters and producers.
                                    The television show was canceled in 1968 but the band continued to record music
                                    through 1971.</p>

                                <p>A revival of interest in the television show came in 1986, which led to a series of
                                    reunion tours and new records.
                                    The group has reunited and toured several times since then with different line-ups
                                    and varying degrees of success.
                                    After Jones died in February 2012, the surviving members reunited for a tour in
                                    Novemberâ€“December 2012 and again in 2013 for a 24-date tour.
                                    The Monkees continued to tour through their 2016 50th anniversary, with Dolenz and
                                    Tork forming the core of the band and Nesmith continuing to join them occasionally.</p>
